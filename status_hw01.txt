5. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I literally had no experience with Linux before this assignment, so
installation had a bunch of setup questions I had no idea how to 
answer. Everything under "Next, set up the web server" was difficult
for me to follow, and some of the instuctions were not very 
descriptive, especially for the first assignment 
(ex. "Create an entry in (your local machine's) /etc/hosts 
for the site.").
